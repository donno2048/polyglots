To understand better what this does read the [example readme](https://github.com/donno2048/polyglots/tree/main/examples)

# install

You might need to install tkinter to use it:

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk -y`

From Pypi:

`py -m pip install polyglots`

From GitHub (recommended):

`py -m pip install git+https://github.com/donno2048/polyglots`

To use it just run:
```py
polyglots
```

If you run this on a zip and a pdf for example, you will end-up with a file you can open as a pdf or as a zip and is actually containing the content of the origin files
